question1:
SD and SEM are connected but have different meanings and interpretations.

Standard deviation: It quantifies the amount of spread or dispersion of the data points in a given dataset. It tells how much individual data points differ from the mean value of the data.
Purpose: It indicates the extent of dispersion of data points from the dataset. A greater SD means great breadth of its distribution of data points around the mean; a less SD means that the data are relatively drawn closely together around the mean.
Standard error of the mean: It describes how accurately the sample mean estimates the true population mean, thus indicating the degree of precision with which we estimate the population mean.
The main distinction between SD and SEM comes into play when considering their purposes: whereas the SD measures variability of individual data points, SEM measures the variability of the mean itself, with small SEM indicating a more accurate estimate of the population mean.
Key differences:
Standard deviation (distribution of data points) describes how data points distribute about the mean.
Standard error of the mean (degree of precision of the mean estimate) describes how much the mean from the sample is expected to deviate from the actual mean for the population.
Since sample size N increases, SEM decreases since larger samples tend to yield better estimates of the population mean. This holds regardless of the variability (or the standard deviation) of the underlying data. 
Summary:
Standard Deviation (SD): Measures the spread or dispersion of individual data points in a dataset, indicating how much they deviate from the mean. It captures how spread out the data is.
Standard Error of the Mean (SEM): Reflects the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean. It decreases with larger sample sizes and is derived from the standard deviation.
Dispersion: Refers to the spread of data points around a central value, like the mean. It relates to how spread out the data is, while scale refers to the magnitude of the numbers themselves.
You also clarified that dispersion is similar to the "spread of the data." It relates to variability, while scale refers to the size of the numbers in a dataset.

question2:
The following synopsis presents a guideline for creating a 95% confidence interval based on the standard error of the mean (SEM):
(1) Calculate the SEM: The standard error is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the sample size.
(2) Determine the required 95% confidence level: The normal distribution has a critical value, which is about 1.96, for the 95% confidence level.
(3) Find the margin of error: The margin of error is calculated as 1.96 multiplied by the SEM.
(4) Construct the confidence interval: The computed margin of error is then added and subtracted from the sample mean to find the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.
The confidence interval so constructed "will cover 95% of bootstrapped sample means"; which means that were you to repeatedly sample from the same population and compute a sample mean over and again, 95% of those means would lie between the interval. 
Summary:
Specifically, you were looking for a concise explanation of the process involved in calculating this interval using the SEM.
 

question3:
In order to create a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval using the bootstrap sample means (without invoking their standard deviation to estimate the sem), you have to do the following:

Which involves generating bootstrap samples: Trying to sample a good number of bootstrapped sample means, ideally, 10,000 bootstrap samples, from your original data with replacement.
Sort the bootstrapped means: Sort the bootstrapped means in increasing order.
Determine the percentiles: In order to include the middle 95% of the distribution, identify the 2.5 percentile (lower bound) and the 97.5 percentile (upper bound) of the ordered bootstrapped sample means.
Construct the confidence interval: The 95% bootstrapped confidence interval is given by the interval running from the lower to the upper percentile. This covers 95% of the bootstrapped sample means directly, given that the standard error has not been calculated.
This adopts an empirically based distribution of the estimated means and is usually more pliable for uneven data. 


```python
#question4#
import numpy as np

# Sample data (replace this with your own sample)
sample = np.array([10, 12, 23, 23, 16, 28, 18, 30, 25, 17])

# Number of bootstrap samples
n_bootstrap = 10000

# Empty list to store the bootstrap sample means
bootstrap_means = []

# Bootstrap process
for _ in range(n_bootstrap):
    # Generate a bootstrap sample by sampling with replacement from the original sample
    bootstrap_sample = np.random.choice(sample, size=len(sample), replace=True)
    
    # Calculate the statistic (mean in this case) for the bootstrap sample
    bootstrap_means.append(np.mean(bootstrap_sample))  # Change this to np.median(bootstrap_sample) for the median

# Sort the bootstrap sample means
bootstrap_means = np.sort(bootstrap_means)

# Calculate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles for the 95% confidence interval
lower_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 2.5)
upper_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 97.5)

# Print the 95% confidence interval for the mean
print(f"95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval for the Mean: ({lower_bound}, {upper_bound})")

# To calculate the confidence interval for the population median instead of the mean:
# 1. Replace np.mean(bootstrap_sample) with np.median(bootstrap_sample) in the bootstrap process.
# 2. The rest of the code remains the same.

# Example for calculating the 95% CI for the median:
# bootstrap_medians = []
# for _ in range(n_bootstrap):
#     bootstrap_sample = np.random.choice(sample, size=len(sample), replace=True)
#     bootstrap_medians.append(np.median(bootstrap_sample))
# bootstrap_medians = np.sort(bootstrap_medians)
# lower_bound_median = np.percentile(bootstrap_medians, 2.5)
# upper_bound_median = np.percentile(bootstrap_medians, 97.5)
# print(f"95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval for the Median: ({lower_bound_median}, {upper_bound_median})")

```

Summary:
Bootstrap Process:
Generate multiple bootstrap samples by randomly sampling with replacement from the original dataset.
For each bootstrap sample, calculate the desired statistic (e.g., mean, median).
Store these statistics and sort them.
Confidence Interval Calculation:
After sorting the bootstrap statistics, the 2.5th percentile gives the lower bound, and the 97.5th percentile gives the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval.
To Change the Statistic:
To calculate a confidence interval for a different parameter (e.g., median instead of mean), modify the code where the statistic is calculated (use np.median() for the median instead of np.mean()).
This method provides a non-parametric way to estimate confidence intervals without relying on assumptions about the data distribution.

question5:
It is important to make a distinction between population parameter and sample statistic because:
A population parameter, for example, the population mean or median, is the true but unknown value that we desire to estimate.
A sample statistic, for example, a sample mean or a median, is the value calculated on the sample data and serves as an estimate for the population parameter.
A confidence interval uses the sample statistic to give a range of plausible values for the unknown population parameter. It is essential to understand the distinction because the sample statistic is a random variable (it is variable from one sample to another), while the population parameter is fixed but unknown. Confidence intervals enable a quantification of uncertainty in using the sample statistic to estimate the population parameter. 
Summary:
Population Parameter: The true, unknown value we want to estimate (e.g., population mean).
Sample Statistic: The value calculated from the sample data (e.g., sample mean), used to estimate the population parameter.
Confidence Interval: Provides a range of plausible values for the population parameter based on the sample statistic. It helps quantify the uncertainty of using the sample statistic to estimate the unknown population parameter.
The key distinction is that the sample statistic is random and changes with different samples, while the population parameter is fixed but unknown.

question6:
1.Bootstrap methods mimic a situation where, hypothetically, it was feasible for more than a single survey or a sample to be taken from the given population. Rather than take more samples out of the population or, possibly, out of the sampling frame (which isn't always guaranteed), new samples are drawn from the existing set of data. Bootstrap works in the following way:

The corresponding survey or sample is the data you have.
You randomly select points from the sample, but with replacement-this is the key reason why some points will be sampled more than once and some not at all.
This process is iterated several times, say, 10,000 times, for the generation of a multitude of bootstrapped samples.
You then obtain certain statistics (like the mean) from each of the new samples, which provides an idea of the extent to which your sample might vary were the sampling process to be repeated multiple times. 
2.Bootstrapping is primarily designed to estimate the uncertainty when typical formulas are out of reach (or when the distribution of the data is unknown). This gives us an idea of how a statistic, say a mean or median, can vary even without the knowledge of little population or data. Bootstrapping allows us to take our observed data to generate lots of simulated samples instead of just guessing. With bootstrapping, you can see how "stable" your result is based on the data you already have. 
3.Say you have a guess (hypothesis) about the mean of a population but have taken only a small sample from the population. Here's the basic procedure to validate whether your guess is plausible using bootstrapping;

Begin with the sample you have.
Use bootstrapping to take many new samples based on that data (with replacement, meaning some values might repeat in each sample).
Calculate the mean of each of these bootstrap samples.
Now, look to see how wide the range is for bootstrap means. If your guessed hypo is close to most of the bootstrap sample means, then your guess could be said to be reasonable.
But when your guess is way off from the mass of those bootstrap sample means, it goes in favor of the fact that your guess is probably not a reasonable guess based on your sample data. 

question7:
Because a confidence interval includes zero, we cannot reject the null hypothesis even when the sample mean differs from zero.
When the confidence interval incorporates zero, it implies that zero is a plausible value for the true population mean, indicating that no effect, e. g., no difference between drug and placebo, is still a possible explanation for the data. This means that, even though your sample mean is (or some might say should be) different from zero, the data could be consistent with an average drug effect of zero (because zero happens to be in the interval). Thus, you don't have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which states there's no effect.

What is it that could lead to rejecting the null hypothesis?
In order to reject the null hypothesis, the evidence must indicate that zero is not a plausible value for the population mean. This occurs when the confidence interval does not overlap with zero; in other words, when the data leads you to believe that the drug has an effect. If the confidence interval is completely to one side of zero, this means the sample mean is far enough from zero to be considered statistically significant. In this case, you would conclude that the drug probably does have an effect on average and you would reject the null hypothesis.

In summary:
Fail to reject-The null hypothesis can be considered rejected in the event that zero cannot be ruled out as part of the confidence interval.
Reject-The confidence interval is the union of zero that affords enough evidence to suggest that an effect exists.
